# Code Review (Phoenix)

Review Phoenix and Elixir code for context boundaries, style, Ecto usage, LiveView practices, and test quality using the **phoenix-code-reviewer** agent.

1. If the user indicated specific files or a diff, review those; otherwise review the current changes (e.g. from Source Control or the last edit).
2. Apply the phoenix-code-reviewer guidelines: context boundaries, idiomatic Elixir, Ecto, LiveView, naming/structure, error handling, tests.
3. Categorize feedback as Critical / Warning / Suggestion and provide concrete references and fixes where applicable.
