# Git Workflow

## Commit Message Format

```
type: short description

optional body
```

Types: feat, fix, refactor, docs, test, chore, perf, ci

## Pull Request Workflow

When creating PRs:
1. Analyze full commit history (not just latest commit)
2. Use `git diff [base-branch]...HEAD` to see all changes
3. Draft comprehensive PR summary
4. Include test plan with TODOs
5. Push with `-u` flag if new branch

## Feature Implementation Workflow

1. **Plan First** — Use planner agent or `/plan` to create implementation plan; identify dependencies and risks; break into phases.
2. **TDD Approach** — Write tests first (RED), implement to pass (GREEN), refactor (IMPROVE). Verify coverage where applicable.
3. **Code Review** — Use code-reviewer agent or `/code-review` after writing code; address CRITICAL and HIGH issues.
4. **Commit & Push** — Detailed commit messages; follow conventional commits format.
