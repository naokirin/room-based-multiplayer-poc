# Rails Action Mailer

- Use the mailer only for building the email; keep business logic outside.
- Set default `from` in `ApplicationMailer`; override per-mailer or per-message when needed.
- Name methods after the notification (e.g. `welcome_email`).
- Use `deliver_later` over `deliver_now` for non-blocking delivery.
- Provide both HTML and text templates when possible. Use mailer previews (`test/mailers/previews/` or `spec/mailers/previews/`) to verify in development.
