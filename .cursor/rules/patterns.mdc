# Common Patterns

## Skeleton Projects

When implementing new functionality:
1. Search for battle-tested skeleton projects
2. Evaluate options (security, extensibility, relevance)
3. Clone best match as foundation
4. Iterate within proven structure

## Design Patterns

### Repository Pattern

Encapsulate data access behind a consistent interface:
- Standard operations: findAll, findById, create, update, delete
- Business logic depends on the abstract interface, not storage
- Enables swapping data sources and simplifies testing with mocks

### API Response Format

Use a consistent envelope for API responses:
- Success/status indicator
- Data payload (nullable on error)
- Error message field (nullable on success)
- Metadata for pagination (total, page, limit)
