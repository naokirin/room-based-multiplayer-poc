# Security Guidelines

## Mandatory Security Checks

Before ANY commit:
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets (API keys, passwords, tokens)
- [ ] All user inputs validated
- [ ] SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries)
- [ ] XSS prevention (sanitized output)
- [ ] CSRF protection enabled where applicable
- [ ] Authentication/authorization verified
- [ ] Rate limiting on endpoints where applicable
- [ ] Error messages don't leak sensitive data

## Secret Management

- NEVER hardcode secrets in source code
- ALWAYS use environment variables or a secret manager
- Validate that required secrets are present at startup
- Rotate any secrets that may have been exposed

## Security Response

If a security issue is found: stop immediately, fix CRITICAL issues before continuing, rotate exposed secrets, review codebase for similar issues.
