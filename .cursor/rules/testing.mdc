# Testing Requirements

## Minimum Test Coverage

Aim for high coverage (e.g. 80% where project defines it). Test types:
1. **Unit Tests** — Individual functions, utilities, components
2. **Integration Tests** — API endpoints, database operations
3. **E2E Tests** — Critical user flows (framework per language)

## Test-Driven Development

Workflow:
1. Write test first (RED)
2. Run test — it should FAIL
3. Write minimal implementation (GREEN)
4. Run test — it should PASS
5. Refactor (IMPROVE)
6. Verify coverage

## Troubleshooting Test Failures

1. Check test isolation
2. Verify mocks are correct
3. Fix implementation, not tests (unless tests are wrong)
